# Workout_Recommender
Yoni Masha

This program takes in a user's workout preferences and spits out a personalized workout schedule.

The program prompts the user to input their desired intensity, days per week, volume, and area of focus. Upon recieving the user's data, the program will run the data through an algorithm and print the workout schedule to the console.

Upon completion of this the program will ask the user if they would like to continue with another set of preferences or if they would like to end the program there.

The program uses many input validation functions that are lenient with inputs (ex. if a user wants to work out five days a week they can input "five" or "5").
